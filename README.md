# System-Programming-and-operating-systems
This repository contains all the assignments listed in subject System Programming and Operating System Lab in Third Year Computer Department of Savitribai Phule Pune University. 
Assignment list:
1) Write a Java/C program to create child process using fork sysyem call. Display status of running processes (ps), use it in child process (exec) and terminate child process before completion of parent task(wait).
2) Write a Java program (using OOP features) to implement paging simulation using
    a) Least Recently Used (LRU)
    b) Optimal algorithm
3) Write a program using Lex specification to implement lexical analysis phase of compiler to generate tokens of subset of 'Java' Program
4) Write a program using Lex specification to implement lexical analysis phase of compiler to count no. of words, lines and characters of given input file. 
5) Write a program using YACC specifications to implement syntax analysis phase of compiler to validate type and syntax of variable declaration in Java.
6) Write a program using YACC specifications to implenment syntax analysis phase of compiiler to recognize simple and compound sentences given in input file. 
7) Design suitable data structures and implement pass-I of a two-pass assembler for pseudo machine in Java using Object Oriented Feature. Implementation should consist of a few instruction from each category and few assembles directives. 
8) Implement Pass-II of two-pass assembler for pseudo-machine in Java using Object Oriented Features. The output of Assignment-I (intermediate file and sy,bol table) should be input for this assignment.
9) Design suitable data structures and implement pass-I of a two-pass macro-processing using OOP features in Java.
10) Write a Java program for pass-II of a two-pass macro-processor. The output of assignment-3 (MNT, MDT and file without any macro-definitions) should be input for this assignment. 
11) Write a java program (using OOP features) to implement following scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SJF (Preemptive), Priority (Non-Preemptive) and Round Robin (Preemptive).
12) Write a Java Program to implement Banker's algorithm.
13) Write a program to create Dynamic Link Library for any mathematical opperation and write an application program to test it. (Java Native Interface / Use VB or VC++)
14) Study assignment on process scheduling algorithms in Android and Tizen.
